import UIKit


//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: The instance variables are implicitly unwrapped optional Strings, whereas the parameters passed in to **init** are optional Strings. Essentially, they are both optional Strings, but an implicitly unwrapped optional gives permission to be automatically unwrapped any time it is used. On the other hand, optional Strings require an exclamation mark to explicitly unwrap whenever it is used.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.
    
    
//: The error says: Can not pass immutable value to a mutating operator. 'i' is a 'let' constant. Essentially, let statements make constants -- values never change. Fixed by changing 'let' to 'var'
//: Another issue is that the function never returns true. We need to add this outside the for loop.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    class func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters : [Character : Int] = [Character: Int]() //Line X
        var lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        var lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return nil
    }
